# Week
Week 6 Practical 5

# Learning Activities
This week I watched the short learning resource video to ensure I was up to date and I suspect understanding its content will be helpful for the group assignment. I also gave myself a refresher on child themes by watching previous weeks learning resource videos and found a few sources on CSS to remind myself of some of the properties which can be used. This was helpful to create the style.css needed for the child theme.

# Estimated Hours

The learning resource video was only 5 minutes and I spent roughly 1.5 hours learning how to create a child theme and some CSS properties. Overall, I spent about 1.5 hours learning this week. 

# Content Insights
I did not take away too many content insights this week as I mostly used the previous weeks videos on child themes as a refresher. However, I did find that it was useful to have an IDE like PhpStorm to work on the files and editing the CSS within the browser is a quicker way to create and test changes. Additionally, daily stand up meetings should be short and too the point. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As WordPress powers a large amount of the internets websites I am sure being able to develop a child theme is a useful skill. By building on from a template you are saving yourself large amounts of time whilst also ensuring your webpage is unique by not just using the default style settings from the template.
