# Estimated Hours
This week I spent approxiametly 4 hours watching the learning resource videos and 1.5 hours reviewing the Sass video. Thus, I spent roughly 5 hours learning this week. 

# Content Insights
When designing a website, it's important to tailor the content to your target audience. This could mean creating personas to identify your ideal user and thinking about how to optimize your site for them. A simple design that enhances the content and serves a purpose is also crucial. To make the design process easier, it's helpful to know what content you'll have so you can plan accordingly and iterate where necessary. When it comes to presenting forms on the site, consider the context in which users will encounter them and make the process as painless as possible. Additionally, having smart content-based navigation is essential, with a home page that leads to categories and detailed pages. This will all be useful when developing the flow of content for the second assignment. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Sass is an extremelly useful tool as it can help to create good CSS quickly. For example, if you require a certain colour to be present for multiple sections of a website it can be stored in a variable which can then be changed and will alter the colour for all elements instead of having to change each individual instance.
