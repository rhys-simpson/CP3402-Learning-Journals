DRY:  
Following the 'dont repeat yourself' method of coding can have many benefits such as, it makes code easy to maintain. For example, you can change code in one place and itâ€™ll change in all the instances thus, only having to write code once.  
Wordpress Rig:  
A fully styled starter theme that can be easily customised and optimises your code. Allows you to easily edit the CSS, php and javascript and create custom backgrounds, footers, website components, etc. It is useful to save time as in some situations it's not practical and doesn't make sense starting everything from scratch, for example, if there is a time constraint. Additionally, you must build the theme first then change the name once its completed and exported    
Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass):  
Sass is used to add more advanced features to coding with CSS. I will know more about this topic when I work on next weeks practical.
