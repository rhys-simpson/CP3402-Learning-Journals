# Week
Week 5 Practical 4

# Learning Activities
- My first learning activity for this week was catching up on the recommended learning resources from week 4, Mapping the Modern Web Design Process, Version Control for Everyone and Migrating WordPress with WP Migrate DB and DB Pro. These videos me to identify effective practices that I could utilise within web development, specifically using the WordPress CMS, to create an effective site that will achieve my desired goal. 

- Next I watched the learning videos for week 5 which included, WordPress: Building Child Themes and Design Responsive WordPress Themes in the Browser which helped with further understanding of WordPress and improving the sites responsiveness.

- Finally I learnt how to create a local development environment with WordPress as the CMS which will help me for the first assignment.

# Estimated Hours
The learning resources took me roughly 7 hours and I spent about 4 hours learning local development. Thus, I spent an estimated 11 hours in total this week learning content. 

# Content Insights
Creating informational user experiences and putting the user first are important for a website to achieve its goal. Additionally, when developing a website it can be useful to create personas that help to identify what users may want from a site as well as how they may interact with certain features. Maintaining effective documentation, like a style guide, can be an extremely useful reference. Utilising a content first approach is a great way to ensure that the site is still accessible to users even if something else fails. This adds to its accessibility and makes the site more reliable. All of these insights can be used during development, and can be implemented by planning with contingencies which can ensure that the websites development and eventual release will be smoother.  

Version control isn't just for writing code as it can be used anywhere, such as powerpoint. This is good to know as it could be implemented in future projects like the final assignments presentation. 

WP Migrate DB Plugin can be used to move a WordPress site from one domain to another, from a local development to a live site or to download a live site to a local environment. To be able to migrate from one site to another you must set up a target site, migrate all files then migrate the database. The WP Migrate DB Plugin is an effective tool which can make this process much simpler and could be useful in future projects/practicals as they require using the WordPress CMS. 

Services such as WAMP or Local by flywheel can be used for local development. Local is a great tool that is extremely easy to use when doing local development. Additionally, the in browser inspect element can be used to quickly change the css and view it how and end user would be viewing it. This can help with creating css which is responsiveness thus, improving the sites user friendliness.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I discovered many things that could be used for career/employability such as, developing websites with a mobile first mentality can help you remove unnecessary elements due to the limited screen space. This is helpful as it will allow you to determine what is the most effective solution to reach the site goals. Accessibility testing is very important as everyone has different ways they will interact with the site. Thus, solutions which are considered to be ready for a client should have the ablility to navigate the entire site without using a mouse and tests should be done by people with visual impairments as an example. Furthermore, css could be disabled to test if the sites content can still be reached by end users. 

With todays social media prevalence it is a good idea to optimise a site for social media sharing to boost exposure/sharing, which depending on a sites goal could be essential for a client. It is important to develop a feedback loop for site issues after launch. This will make users feel heard, help to identify and fix issues. Putting something like this in place will mean the solution being given to the client is better received by users and has a higher likelihood of being a viable solution for a longer period of time. Proof of work should also be made available for a client.  

# Description Of What Was Used To Setup Local Environment
- First attempt
I first attempted use XAMPP to set up phpMyAdmin, mySQL and FileZilla to create a local development environment but I couldn't make the wp-install file work correctly. 

- Second attempt
I downloaded Local by flywheel and used their simple program to create a locally hosted WordPress.org site which, has connections to a mysql database.
