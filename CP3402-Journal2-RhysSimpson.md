# Week
Week 3 Practical 2

# Learning Activities
This week I focused on two main learning activities:
- Watch the recommended learning resource, WordPress Workflows, which is an introduction to Wordpress that will be useful for the next practical as the practical requires making a site using Wordpress. 
- Start using Joomla CMS to build a basic site, which will help me get a start on Assignment 1.

# Estimated Hours
This week I spent approxiametly 4.5 hours towards learning for this subject, roughly 2 for the learning course and 2.5 for the Joomla CMS. 

# Content Insights
I found that most of my learning from this week didn't come from traditional researching but instead came from trial and error and using the Joomla CMS / Cloud Access Platform software. This approach was in part due to the limited time I had this week and I feel I only somewhat understand the full breadth of creating a site using Joomla. Although the site I produced for this practical is simple and similar to the default Joomla template I was able to see how creating your own layout for the site or resourcing someone elses available online template is a very important step in making a site distinguishable and to help reach its goal. Furthermore, I learnt how Joomla uses articles, categories, modules, menus, etc. to structure a website and it seems similar to Wordpress's blocks.    

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Using Joomla CMS gave me some basic insights into how a CMS might help a developer to create and improve a website. Furthermore, the predefined modules and website sections have made me start to think about why certain website elements are already developed by many CMS's which I feel is because they are widely used and can be used to improve a site's ability to reach its goal. Thus, I will carefully consider how I could incorporate these elements, such as a login feature or breadcrumbs, into future websites.
