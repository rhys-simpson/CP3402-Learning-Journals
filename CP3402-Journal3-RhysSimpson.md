# Week
Week 4 Practical 3

# Learning Activities
** I made a mistake in last weeks learning journal by stating I watched the recommended learning resource video, Wordpress Workflows, when in fact the video I watched was WordPress 5 Essential Training

- This week I watched the video Wordpress Workflows which was useful as it outlined some of the useful features of WordPress and the benefits, which will be helpful for the first assignment.

- Used the WordPress CMS to gain some experience before creating the local website for the assignment submission.

# Estimated Hours
Overall I spent roughly 2 hours this week learning, the learning video took roughly an hour and I spent about an hour working in WordPress.

# Content Insights
To set WordPress on a live host you need, a domain name, storage space for WordPress and a database. Being explained this has helped me to better understand the role of a CMS within website deployment. WordPress can be used to easily created and publish content and it's more effective to create the content within WordPress itself opposed to making it in a third party program then pasting it into Wordpress. This is because, it may copy over with undesired formatting. Child themes allow you to take desired aspects of the original site's theme but only change the features you want. I think that this could be useful as you can use the original theme to make a site quickly and then use a child theme to make it unique. Additionally, WordPress is extremely intuitive due to the blocks which separate content on a page. This makes it easier to display and highlight features which are relevant to achieving the site goals. Furthermore, local installs of sites are useful as you can work on them without having to be connected to the internet. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The learning I conducted this week almost entirely built upon learning I had completed in the previous weeks. For example, finally using WordPress helped me to understand the service more in depth but all of the features felt familiar and easy to use as I had watched all of the recommended learning videos and lectures. My main take away this week is that I am falling behind which is decreasing my ability to produce quality work and as I rushed through this week I devalued the little learning that I did. Furthermore, to fulling understand how to develop locally for the assignment I am really going to have to watch more tutorials for next week's learning.
