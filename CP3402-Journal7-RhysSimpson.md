# Learning Activities
This week I watched one of the learning resource videos on PHP to get an introduction to the language. I also found some extra resources for further clarification. This will be useful when developing form submissions for the website in assignment 2, such as a contact us page.

# Estimated Hours
I spent roughly 5 hours learning new content this week.

# Content Insights
PHP is in use by over 80% of websites and is used to develop and maintain interactive websites. PHP uses Bomdas for mathematical calculations. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
It is a server side coding language and uses many elements I'm already familiar with such as arrays, if/else, or ( || ), objects, classes etc. It's wide use on the internets websites shows its uses, and I am sure implementing PHP in something such as a login form, or contact form and its ability to connect that information to a database is extremelly useful in real world scenarios.
