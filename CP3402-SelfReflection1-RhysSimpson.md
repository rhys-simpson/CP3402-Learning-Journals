Week 2 Practical 1

# Learning Activities

- Watched the recommened Learning Resource, Introduction to Web Design and Development, within the Calendar Github. 
- Researched different IDE's that I could use to write HTML and CSS. 
- Relearning the basics of HTML and CSS through video tutorials and websites such as W3schools as I haven't used either of the languages in over 18 months. 
- Researched Github pages to learn how to host a website.
- Researched Markdown to understand its purpose and also find a useful tool to write Markdown documents.

# Estimated Hours

I spent roughly 8 hours learning this week. 2 hours were for the Introduction to Web Design and Development Linkedin Learning course and 6 hours learning content for the practical. 

# Content Insights

My main content insights for this week were relearning HTML and CSS which included the different functions and features that each language offers the programmer. Such as, in HTML needing to separate different sections using "div" and being able to create classes in CSS. Furthermore, I learned that there is a seemingly endless amount of CSS and HTML templates which can be used to create websites although, at first I did find it difficult to actually utilise these within my code. Initially I was watching a youtube tutorial and writing the HTML and CSS from scratch but eventually it sort of 'clicked' as to how I could implement the templates and what the function of the links within the head of the HTML document actually was. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I found that immediately going to the Bootstrap and Github pages as well as looking at the learning journals first overwhelemed me for this practical as I was unsure how either of them worked and didn't fully understand what to do. After I conducted more research and relearned some of the basics of HTML and CSS completing the practical became far easier.   
Being able to freely explore and choose various different options to complete this task is very similar to how I currently handle things at work, in a sense, and the minimal hand holding has helped me discover useful information I might not of if I was simply following a set list of instructions.
